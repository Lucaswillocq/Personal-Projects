Creating a program to help aid with solutions to the popular online game 'Wordle'

Background:

  Wordle is a simple, rapidly growing daily game in which users attempt to guess a five-letter word in less than 6 attempts.  With each new guess of a word, Wordle notifies the user if the letters in the word are either:
  
  Green - The letter is in the correct position of the true word
  Yellow - The letter is in the true word, but not at the correct position
  Grey - The letter is not in the true word
  
  With this program, I aim to create a program that would aid users with solving this puzzle by eliminating words that do not fit the previous criteria, until there is a finite list of possible words.  I hope to also keep the list updated so that it can account for words that have been already the Wordle of the day, and therefore eliminating them from the list of possibilities.
